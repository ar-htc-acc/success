If you don't want the additional directory level in your git repository, you need to enable the "Use or create repository in parent folder of project" option at the very top of the "Configure Git Repository" dialog (Team -> Share Project... -> Git).

However, this will create the repository directly in your workspace and not in the default repository folder, which is not recommended. But you can move the project to the right place and re-import it into your workspace in a second step.

Another option would be to create the repository on github first. Afterwards you can clone the github repository and move your code into it.
